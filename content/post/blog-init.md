Let's start writing, sharing and have some fun. let's init Blog :)
<!--more-->

After a long time, finally I decided to start blogging. Its purpose is dul; 
First, document my adventures in software development, architecture, deployment and mostly data science as a way to reinforce concepts I am learning and implementing into projects.
Secondly, it is a great platform to share my perspective on miscellaneous subjects, in which I hope can spark meaningful discussion from all viewpoints. 

stay tuned :)
