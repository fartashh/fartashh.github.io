title = "Create a Natural Language Question Answering system with IBM Watson"
+++

Recently I started a new project to build QA system for Mindvalley. After a short discussion with my colleagues we decided 
to use the 2011 jeopardy winner *Watson*.

As you may know Watson is a question answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language,
it developed in IBM's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci. 

IBM also released it's cloud platform *IBM Bluemix* in 2014. It supports several programming languages and services 
as well as integrated DevOps to build, run, deploy and manage applications on the cloud. 
And of-course Watson API's are accessible in Bluemix platform.
